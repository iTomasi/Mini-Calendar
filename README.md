My first project made with typescript which I will try to improve little by little the way that I am using the language

this is a calendar made with react (front-end) and nodejs (backend) both written in typescript

PD: I will not include the modules related to typescript, I will only say the modules that depend completely on the development for the user visualization.

NodeJS Modules:

<ul>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>Dotenv (Save private datas)</li>
  <li>Cors (so that another server can make requests to the backend)</li>
  <li>MySQL (Database)</li>
</ul>

this project does is that you can save important things on a specific day, at which you can also delete it

<h2>How to Install</h2>

download this repository and open it, go to server folder and write in your cmd <strong>npm i</strong> for install all dependencies then go to "server/databases/db.sql" and copy paste that in your MySQL Database (need to create a database first). After go to "server" again and in your cmd write <strong>npm run dev</strong> or <strong>npm build and npm start</strong> when the server is running go to client folder and write <strong>npm start</strong> with all this the project should work.

This project may be very simple for some, but it helps me to continue progressing in this wonderful world of programming.
