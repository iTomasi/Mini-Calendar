My first project made with typescript which I will try to improve little by little the way that I am using the language

this is a calendar made with react (front-end) and nodejs (backend) both written in typescript

NodeJS Modules:

<ul>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>Dotenv (Save private datas)</li>
  <li>Cors (so that another server can make requests to the backend)</li>
  <li>MySQL (Database)</li>
</ul>

this project does is that you can save important things on a specific day, at which you can also delete it
